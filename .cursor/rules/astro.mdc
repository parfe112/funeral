# Astro 5 Rules

## Project Structure
- All Astro components should be placed in the `src/components/` directory
- All pages should be placed in the `src/pages/` directory
- All layouts should be placed in the `src/layouts/` directory
- All global styles should be placed in the `src/styles/` directory
- All assets (images, fonts) should be placed in the `src/assets/` directory

## Naming Conventions
- Astro component files should use the `.astro` extension
- Component file names should use PascalCase (e.g. `HeaderNavigation.astro`)
- Page file names should use kebab-case (e.g. `about-us.astro`)

## Best Practices
- Use the `client:load` property only when immediate interactivity is necessary
- Use `client:visible` for components that need to be interactive only when visible
- Use `client:idle` for components that can wait until the browser is idle
- Minimize JavaScript sent to the client by using server-side rendering when possible
- Use `import.meta.env` for environment variables
- Use `getStaticPaths()` for dynamic route generation

## Astro 5 Specifications
- Use the new View Transitions system for page transitions
- Use the Content Collections API for structured content
- Implement Server Endpoints for APIs and middleware
- Use the new `<Code />` and `<Prism />` tags for code display
